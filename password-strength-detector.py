# Write a function that uses regular expressions to make sure the password string it is passed is strong. 
# A strong password is defined as one that is at least eight characters long, 
# contains both uppercase and lowercase characters, 
# and has at least one digit. 
# You may need to test the string against multiple regex patterns to validate its strength.

#Work on a more concise solution.
